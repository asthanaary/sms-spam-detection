# sms-spam-detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect spam messages in SMS text data. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data and a classifier to identify whether a message is spam or ham (not spam). The project demonstrates the complete pipeline â€” from data cleaning and vectorization to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Key Features
Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Classification using ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

(Optional) Streamlit or Flask app for real-time message classification

Dataset
The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains 5,000+ labeled SMS messages as 'spam' or 'ham'. Available at UCI Machine Learning Repository.
